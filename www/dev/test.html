<p>While we were already looking forward to the N800 Internet Tablet's inevitable successor, it seems like Sprint may have something else in mind. According to LinuxDevices, the operator "will offer a mobile WiMAX-enabled version of Nokia's N800 <a href="http://thongtincongnghe.net">Internet Tablet</a> to North American customers next year," which reportedly falls in line with the carrier's grand scheme of making 4G services available "to over 100 million people during 2008." Furthermore, Nokia's director of open source, Dr. Ari Jaaksi, was quoted as saying that this here device would "most probably" include Wi-Fi and Bluetooth as well, but as expected, no details regarding a specific launch timeframe were divulged.</p>
